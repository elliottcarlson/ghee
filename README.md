[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ghee.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ghee)

ghee is an ES6 based wrapper/helper for Slack's official client. It is
specifically built to be used with ES7 decorators to make defining methods the
bot can respond to easy to define without much overhead.

### Why "ghee"?

It started off as the basis for ghebot, a bot to assist in monitor and alerting
for GitHub Enterprise. ghee is now the underlying framework for ghebot. Also,
_it's clear to use and smooth as butter_.
