# ghee

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ghee.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/ghee)

_ghee_ is an ES7 based wrapper for Slack's official npm client. It is built with
ease of implementation in mind, and utilizes ES7 decorators to easily define
methods that your bot should respond to.

_ghee_ has built in support to respond to requests via Promises, and allows you
to easily build attachments to the message response.

While you can easily use _ghee_ on it's own, it is recommended to install and use
the [ghee boilerplate](https://github.com/elliottcarlson/ghee-boilerplate/),
which will ensure that your environment is ready to handle ES7 with decorators.

Please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/elliottcarlson/ghee/wiki) for usage
instructions. See the [Samples](https://github.com/elliottcarlson/ghee#samples)
for various bots that implement _ghee_.

### Why "_ghee_"?

It started off as the basis for ghebot, a bot to assist in monitor and alerting
for GitHub Enterprise. ghee is now the underlying framework for ghebot. Also,
_it's clear to use and smooth as butter_.
